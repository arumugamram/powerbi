 Power BI Tip – Better Y-Axis Labels: M for Thousands, MM for Millions!

Ever wanted your line charts in Power BI to show 1.2M for thousands and 2.5MM for millions on the Y-axis — just like your finance team prefers?

Well... I just built exactly that! 📈

🔧 Using a Python visual inside Power BI, I created a line chart with:
✅ Clean formatting (M for 1,000s, MM for 1,000,000s)
✅ Custom Y-axis logic
✅ Easy integration with any dataset


🎁 Bonus: Added full sample data and a month-wise trend so it looks great even in demos!
